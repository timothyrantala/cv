      <p>I began my career in <strong>Web Development</strong> online at W3schools.com.
        After spending several days learning the basics there, I moved on to Codecademy.com
        which I thought did a much better job of explaining the <em>Rules</em> associated
        with coding. My next step in the long arduous process of learning to <strong>Code</strong> was Udemy.com with the course
        By <em>Angela Yu: The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp</em>.</p></td>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Oakwood High School</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is where I attended high school. It was
          pretty normal I assume, I had friends and enemy's. I felt like it was too simple,
          as if it wasn't even relevant to my success in life.

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em><a href="https://www.af.mil/">United States Air Force</a></em>.
      <ul>
        <li>This is where I learned how to accomplish goals, specifically I learned hard work,
          dedication, and perserverance will help you succeed.
          I attended multiply schools throughout my career in the <strong>Air Force</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </li>
    <li><em>Navarro Community College</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>I took classes here for a couple years.
          I thought that it was interesting when I went to classes, but after I started
          taking online classes my interest and enthusiasm waned.</li>
